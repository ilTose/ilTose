## ⚽ Football
As a lifelong football fan, I am intrigued by the use of technology to improve both the performance of players and the understanding of the game itself. I have been researching the application of AI technologies to this field, including player tracking, tactical analysis, and even predicting game outcomes.

## 🎮 Video games
Since my childhood, video games have always been a big part of my life. I have always been fascinated by their ability to transport us to different worlds, test our skills, and even bring people together.
